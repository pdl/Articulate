# Articulate, a Lightweight Perl CMS Framework

Articulate is intended to provide a flexible and lightweight core for content management which can be customised using plugins.

Articulate uses modern Perl and tries to avoid huge dependencies, while making use of really good bits of CPAN like Moo, Module::Load and IO::All.

Right now it runs atop Dancer1, but the intention is to ensure it also supports Dancer2 and maybe some other frameworks if there is demand.

Initial concept work on Articulate started in early 2014 and it was rewritten from scratch in November 2014.
