=head1 NAME

Articulate::Authorisation::AlwaysAllow - don't use this in production

=cut

=head1 CONFIGURATION

Put this in your C<development.yml>, NOT in your C<config.yml> or your C<production.yml>. You have been warned.

  plugins:
    Articulate::Authorisation:
      providers:
        - Articulate::Authorisation::AlwaysAllow

There's nothing else to configure, the answer is always yes.

=head1 METHODS

=head3 new

Does what all good C<new> methods do, nothing more.

=head3 permitted

Handles all the complex business logic required to ensure that the request is always authorised.

So don't use this in production.

=cut

sub permitted {
  my $self       = shift;
  my $permission = shift;
  $permission->grant('Anything is possible!');
}

=head1 BUGS

Don't come crying to me if you use this in production.

=cut
