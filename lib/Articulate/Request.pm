=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head3 verb

The action being performed, e.g. C<create>, C<read>, etc. The verbs available are entirely dependant on the application: A request will be handled by a service provider (see Articulate::Service) which will typically decide if it can fulfil the request based on the verb.

=cut

has verb =>
  is      => 'rw',
  default => sub { 'error' };

=head3 data

The information passed along with the request, e.g. C<< { location => '/zone/public/article/hello-world' } >>. This should always be a hashref.

=cut

has data =>
  is      => 'rw',
  default => sub { { } };
